# Tri-Jake-Project-1

Imagine being new to school and not having anywhere to blow off some steam. Well you're in luck! Tri and Jakes Bar Rater has you covered! We have a wonderful array of bars with excellent reviews. On our site you can view each bar with a click of a button. What's that? you had a great experience and want other people to know about it? We have you covered on that front too. Use the comment feature to leave a raving review, and also give it a rating. We appreciate everyone's input and display the average rating for everyone to see. So let your opinion be heard! But, Tri and Jake, I have a suggestion for a great bar just down the street. What should I do? Once again we have you covered. All you gotta do is scroll down and input the required information in the new bar submission field. Then you are just one click away from seeing your new recommendation featured with the rest of the fine establishments. And yes, you can comment on and rate this new addition. 

Diving into the nitty gritty. This website uses a json server for it"s database of bars. The database has five static objects with five keys. Two of the keys even contain arrays within their values. We have an astounding six eventListeners. Additionally there are not one but two forEach loops included in the code. With these attributes I can say with confidence that this project meets all of the MVP requirements with a little extra effort sprinkled on top.
